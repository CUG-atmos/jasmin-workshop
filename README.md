# jasmin-workshop
Materials and code for JASMIN workshops.

The workshop makes use of the exercises listed below to enable users to become familiar with the JASMIN environment.
If you are unable to attend one of the workshops in person, you may find it useful to watch the following [Overview Presentation](https://youtu.be/ScmLvdgqAUw) which is normally given at the workshop:


| Exercise | Topic | Resources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ex01 | Accessing and using the JASMIN “scientific analyis” severs | [Resources](./exercises/ex01) |
| ex02 | Copy data to JASMIN to share with collaborators | [Resources](./exercises/ex02) |
| ex03 | Processing on the scientific analysis servers | [Resources](./exercises/ex03) |
| ex04 | A script to extract 1 variable from a file in the CEDA Archive | [Resources](./exercises/ex04) |
| ex05 | Batch run a script on LOTUS | [Resources](./exercises/ex05) |
| ex06 | Choosing the right storage for your workflow | [Resources](./exercises/ex06) |
| ex07 | Manage a multi-step workflow | [Resources](./exercises/ex07) |
| ex08 | Building your own Python 3 environment | [Resources](./exercises/ex08) |
| ex09 | Compile and run parallel Fortran code on LOTUS | [Resources](./exercises/ex09)

If you are using the materials individually (outside of an organised workshop event) then you will need to use your own JASMIN account and a group workspace which you already belong to, rather than the training accounts, and workshop group workspace, respectively. Instead of the workshop LOTUS queue, please use the short-serial queue in this case.
